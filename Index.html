            <p>Having lived on both U.S. coasts, I’ve been humbled by the passivity of Seattle and the aggression of
                Philadelphia. By default, I work independently, but I’m enthusiastic to work with others. There’s high
                value in collaboration and diversity. I welcome feedback on anything I produce, whether it be a knitted
                hat, a cheesecake, or a clunky chunk of code. </p>

            <p>After graduating with a Psychology degree from West Chester University of Pennsylvania, I returned to
                Seattle. I accepted a job as a phone-based tobacco cessation counselor in a lovely downtown high-rise,
                equipped with all the free coffee and corporate benefits one could desire. That job had me seeking a
                nannying position within 6 months of hire. I signed on with a high-tech family of five and never looked
                back.</p>

            <p>As a full-time household manager/childcare provider, I often find myself continuously mulling over house
                projects and scheduling. It’d be logical to pursue a career in project management with such experience,
                but programming seems to provide an even greater challenge and allow me to exercise my creativity.
                Modifying recipes or knitting patterns, conceptualizing a painting or comic layout, and bringing a piece
                of clay to a satisfied form on a potter’s wheel are endeavors not unlike coding. There are steps,
                formulas, and the audacity of our own creativity to produce something from scratch. It’s my ambition to
                learn all that I can about programming because I’m ready for a hearty challenge, a career change, and an
                opportunity to network with tenacious peers.</p>
